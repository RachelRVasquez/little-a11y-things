# Little A11y Things

Welcome to my little collection of accessible things! This is a small React app meant to display accessible code snippets
for developers. Includes tabs to switch between "Code Mode" and "Visual Mode" along with brief descriptions and links
to further reading.

I intend to add more elements and code snippets, and to improve the app over time.
