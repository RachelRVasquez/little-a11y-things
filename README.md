# Little A11y Things

Welcome to my little collection of accessible things! This is a small React app meant to display accessible code snippets
for developers. Includes tabs to switch between "Code Mode" and "Visual Mode", along with brief descriptions and links
to further reading.

I intend to add more elements and improve the app over time.

## Project Build

This project is a dockerized [Vite project](https://vite.dev/), using React + Typescript.

- To run locally: `docker compose up`
- To build in dev mode and see changes in real time: `npm run dev`
