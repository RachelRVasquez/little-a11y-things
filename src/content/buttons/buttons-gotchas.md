### Accessibility gotchas

*   If your button does not contain text (an icon only button), then provide alternative text for screen readers to read out loud.
*   Prevent screen readers from trying to read out SVG icons with `aria-hidden=”true”`. I’ve given examples in the demo area earlier in this page.
