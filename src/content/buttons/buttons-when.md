### When to use it?

*   To trigger dialogs.
*   To trigger popovers.
*   To expand and collapse a mobile menu.
*   To toggle between light and dark themes, like the button on this site!
*   To add or remove rows of data within a form before submission.
*   To add an item to a shopping cart.
*   And more! This is by no means a full-list of what you can use buttons for.
