            <h1>Little A11y Things</h1>
            <p className="tagline">It's the little things that matter!</p>

            <h2>Welcome to my little collection of accessible things!</h2>
            <p>Here you'll find accessible code snippets, see how said code works, and learn
            from fluff-free documentation. I only have a <i>dialog</i> component for now, but
            there'll be more coming soon!</p>

            <p>I hope these small, or shall I say little, pieces of knowledge are easier
                for developers to digest, and will make a big difference in the long run.</p>

            <p>(I also wanted an excuse to use React so here you go! Enjoy!)</p>
