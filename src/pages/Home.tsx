            <p>Welcome to my little collection of accessible things! Accessibility can feel like such a huge topic,
                and the documentation can be tough on the eyes (and the brain.) I wanted to make
                something that simplifies those concepts. Breaks it down into smaller pieces. Something that gets
                straight to the point, and provides code samples that developers can grab and use in the real world.</p>

            <p>I also wanted an excuse to use React so here you go! Enjoy!</p>
